# Lexo Mobile Application

Welcome to Lexo's mobile application repository built with React Native and Expo CLI.

For the backend, please refer to the [func-lexo](https://github.com/G1GACHADS/func-lexo) repository

## ðŸ“Š Requirements

- Node & NPM
- Expo Go Android/iOS Application (Alternatively, you can use an Android/iOS emulator)

## ðŸ›  Setup

Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/G1GACHADS/lexo_frontend.git
```

Install the dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

To start the application, run

```bash
npm start
```

## ðŸ“± Usage

1. To run the application on your phone, you will need to download the **Expo Go** application from the **Play Store** or **App Store**. Otherwise if you have an emulator you can skip this step
2. Once you have the application installed, you can scan the QR code that appears in the terminal after running `npm start` or you can type the command `a` to run the application on an Android emulator or `i` to run the application on an iOS emulator.
3. You can now use the application
4. Try to take a picture of a book, poster or any other document and see the magic happen!
5. Once the app finishes processing the image, you can now see the text that was extracted from the image in bionic text form.
6. Additionally, you can use Text-to-Speech to listen to the text that was extracted from the image, configure the bionic settings, text style and even changing the theme of the application.
7. And that is it! You can now use the application to extract text from images and convert it to bionic text.
